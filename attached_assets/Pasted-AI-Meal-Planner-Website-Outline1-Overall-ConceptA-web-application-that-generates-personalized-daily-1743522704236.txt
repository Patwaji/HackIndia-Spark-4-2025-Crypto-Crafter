AI Meal Planner Website Outline1. Overall ConceptA web application that generates personalized daily meal plans (breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner) based on user-defined criteria:Food Preferences: Type of cuisine, dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.), disliked ingredients.Health Goals: Muscle gain, weight loss, maintenance, specific health conditions (e.g., diabetes-friendly).Budget: Maximum daily or per-meal cost.The core functionality relies on a backend algorithm to process these inputs and suggest meals that fit the criteria, including estimated cost, and detailed nutritional information (calories, protein, carbs, fats, etc.) retrieved via an external API.2. Website PagesHome Page:Purpose: Introduce the service, highlight key benefits (personalized, budget-friendly, goal-oriented), and provide a clear call-to-action (CTA) to get started.Content: Compelling headline, brief explanation, visuals, testimonials (placeholders), "Get Started" button, standard header/footer.How It Works Page:Purpose: Explain the process in more detail.Content: Step-by-step guide, visual aids, brief explanation of the backend's role (processing inputs, querying recipes/API), CTA.Features Page:Purpose: Detail the specific benefits and functionalities.Content: Personalization, Budget Control, Goal Alignment, Accurate Nutritional Info (via API), Variety, Ease of Use.Meal Planner/Generator Page (Core Tool):Purpose: Collect user input and display the generated meal plan.Input Section: Interactive form (built with React) for Food Preferences, Health Goal, and Budget. "Generate Plan" button.Output Section (Appears after generation): Dynamically displays the generated meal plan (Breakfast, Lunch, Snack, Dinner) with meal names, estimated costs, and detailed nutritional info (calories, macros P/C/F) fetched from the Nutrition API. Includes total estimates and Regenerate/Start Over options.3. Key Features & FunctionalityUser Input Form: Intuitive and interactive React-based form to capture preferences, goals, and budget.Backend Algorithm & API Integration: The core logic (developed in Python/Flask) that:Takes user inputs from the React frontend.Accesses a database of recipes/food items suitable for different criteria (cuisines, diets, goals).Selects potential meals matching user preferences, goals, and budget constraints.Crucially, queries an external Nutrition API (e.g., Spoonacular, Edamam, USDA FoodData Central) to retrieve accurate nutritional data (calories, macros, potentially micronutrients) for the selected meals.Calculates estimated costs (this might require a separate data source or estimation logic).Formats the final plan with all details and sends it back to the React frontend.Results Display: Clear presentation of the generated meal plan within the React application.Responsiveness: The website UI (React + CSS/Tailwind) must adapt to desktop and mobile devices.4. Required Technology StackFrontend: React (JavaScript library for building the user interface), styled with Tailwind CSS.Backend: Python language with the Flask web framework.Nutrition Data: Mandatory use of an external Nutrition API (developer to choose a suitable one based on features, data accuracy, and API limits/costs - e.g., Spoonacular, Edamam).Database: A database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) likely needed for storing basic recipe information, user data (if accounts are added later), or potentially caching API responses.5. User FlowUser interacts with the React frontend, landing on the Home Page.User navigates to the Meal Planner Page.User fills out the input form.On clicking "Generate Plan", the React app sends the user's criteria to the Python/Flask backend API.The Flask backend processes the request, selects meals, queries the Nutrition API for details, calculates costs, and compiles the plan.The Flask backend sends the complete meal plan data back to the React frontend.The React app dynamically updates the Output Section to display the received meal plan.User reviews the plan.6. Future Enhancements (Optional)User accounts (requires backend logic and database integration).Weekly meal planning.Grocery list generation.Recipe links/instructions (potentially retrieved from the Nutrition API or recipe database).
